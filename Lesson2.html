        <h1>Exploring Computer Science & Machine Learning</h1>
        <p>Computer Science is the foundation of modern technology, encompassing the study of computers, programming,
            algorithms, data structures, and computational problem-solving. It powers everything from apps to artificial
            intelligence.</p>

        <h2>Venturing into Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, enables systems to learn from data, identify
            patterns, and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It’s used in applications like
            image recognition, chatbots, and recommendation systems.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts in Computer Science for ML</h2>
        <p>Before diving into ML, a solid foundation in computer science is essential. Key areas include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Programming:</b> Languages like Python are widely used for their simplicity and ML libraries.</li>
            <li><b>Data Structures:</b> Arrays, lists, and dictionaries organize data for ML algorithms.</li>
            <li><b>Algorithms:</b> Understanding sorting, searching, and optimization is crucial for ML efficiency.</li>
            <li><b>Mathematics:</b> Linear algebra, calculus, and statistics underpin ML models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started with ML</h2>

                <td>Master Python basics (variables, loops, functions) as it’s the go-to language for ML.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Explore ML Types</td>
                <td>Understand supervised learning (e.g., regression), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering), and
                    reinforcement learning.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Use ML Libraries</td>
                <td>Start with TensorFlow, scikit-learn, or PyTorch for building and training models.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Practice with Datasets</td>
                <td>Work on datasets from Kaggle or UCI to apply ML techniques like classification or regression.</td>
